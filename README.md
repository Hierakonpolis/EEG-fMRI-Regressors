# EEG-fMRI-Regressors
This repository contains code and notebooks used in the paper [EEG-to-fMRI Prediction for Neurofeedback: Evaluating Regularized Regression and Clustering Approaches](will be added after biorxiv link is ready).

To replicate these results you will also need the dataset we used, [A multi-modal human neuroimaging dataset for data integration: simultaneous EEG and fMRI acquisition during a motor imagery neurofeedback task: XP2](https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds002338.v2.0.2).

Experiments can be run by following the notebooks, and referring to the imported functions and classes. Keep in mind that calculating the high-resolution Stockwell transforms for the first time will take quite a bit of time and memory.
